Martin Qvarnstr√∂m SUT22 Campus Varberg, mqvarnstrom80@gmail.com  
  
### Functions
The bot has some simple response/interaction functions, the main feature is a webscraping function which scans a website containing lectures at Campus Varberg and lets the users(students) in the Discord server(created for our class SUT22) know if there are any lectures on site that day. If there are any the bot will send a message to a channel at 08:00  with all the relevant information.  

### Purpose
Made for fun and for the purpose of learning C#, .NET, webscraping and how Discord bots work.
